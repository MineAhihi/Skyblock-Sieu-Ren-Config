#This is a update for the Anti Portal Trap plugin that was abandoned. So I brought it back
#for 1.8!
#This is the config for the Anti Nether Portal Trapping plugin!
#It's very simple. All you need to do is config what blocks allowed can be next to the portal on
#teleport.
#Please use the template below. There are some already set for example.
#You can use this website to get the block ID's and maybe find some more blocks that could
#be abused by players to trap someone!

#Have fun!
