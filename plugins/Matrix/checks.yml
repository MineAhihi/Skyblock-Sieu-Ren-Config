#### Matrix Config - checks.yml ####################################################
#
#     Hi, welcome to use Matrix anti-cheat, this is checks.yml, used to define
#  the settings and behaviors of each checks. You can set the parameters of
#  each check here, and you can also define how to perform actions after each
#  check detects a player cheating.
#
#  CAUTION! If you encounter any false positives and bypasses, you should first
#  consider reporting this BUG. Adjusting the configuration file will not really
#  fix the false positives and bypasses!
#
#  - What is "VL"?
#        "VL" is the abbreviation of "Violation Level". When the player is marked
#    as cheating by anti-cheating, the anti-cheating will increase the player's
#    violation level. When the player's VL reaches the value in the "commands"
#    node below, the corresponding command will be executed.
#
#  - If you encounter any problems, please go to our official Discord
#  group for help: https://discord.gg/pEvY55J
#
#  Anyway, thanks for using Matrix anticheat! ❤
